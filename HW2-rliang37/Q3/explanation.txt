In explanation.txt, explain when we may want to use such nonlinear scales as square root scale and log scale in charts, in no more than 50 words.

Linear graphs are scaled so that equal vertical distances represent the same absolute-dollar-value change. A drop from $10,000 to $9,000, for example, is represented in the same way as a drop from $100,000 to $99,000.
However, nonlinear scales , such as the logarithmic scale reveals percentage changes. A change from 100 to 200, for example, is presented in the same way as a change from 1,000 to 2,000.
